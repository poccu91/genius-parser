[Sampled: Lil Jyule - Do I Hate Ya?]
Hate ya, do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature
Do I hate ya? Do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature

Do I hate ya? Do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature
Do I hate ya? Do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature

(Do I hate ya?)

[Verse]
Give me some, give me some
Bitch you ain't shit with that gun
Talkin’ like you bout it, bout it
Frontin’ like you is the one

Fuck the sun, give me dark
Hate I have, it fills my heart
Close my eyes and then I start
To transform in the deep part

Into the sky (hate ya) I touch the moon
Turns to red, I’m causing gloom
Hear the boom from the bass
In your chest yo heart it race

Never will you see my face
It gives my music better taste
Fuck 'em with the real phonk
And leave their bodies left to waste

Try to run (hate ya) but you can’t hide
Scoping with my bright red eyes
Just the demon in disguise
The black side’s where I reside

Feelin’ tough, well bitch then jump
Anger problems keep me stuck
Inside a life of solitude
But man, I just don’t give a fuck

Hate ya, do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature
Do I hate ya? Do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature

Do I hate ya? Do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature
Do I hate ya? Do I hate ya?
It's my nature, it's my nature (x3)

(Do I-)
